# Azure Linux Web App Blueprint - Enterprise Networked Web App
#
# This blueprint provides a highly secure and network-isolated deployment pattern for hosting
# enterprise-grade applications on Azure Linux Web Apps. It is designed for organizations that
# require strict perimeter control, internal-only exposure, and infrastructure that aligns with
# corporate networking and compliance policies.
#
# üõ°Ô∏è Use Cases Supported:
# - Deploying internal line-of-business (LOB) apps that must not be publicly exposed
# - Hosting enterprise APIs behind a private VNet or Application Gateway
# - Restricting web app access to only approved corporate offices or partner networks
# - Supporting hybrid cloud apps that live in a private networking topology
#
# üß© Key Capabilities:
# - Virtual Network Integration (regional or with App Service Environment)
# - Support for App Service Environment v3 (`app_service_environment_id`)
# - Configurable IP restrictions with named allow/deny rules
# - Optional header-based filtering using X-Forwarded-For
# - System-assigned or user-assigned managed identity
# - Secure TLS configuration (TLS 1.2 or higher, FTPS control)
# - Full support for tags, connection strings, and app settings
# - Slot-based deployment and sticky site configurations
#
# üåç Real-World Scenarios:
# - A healthcare provider hosts an internal patient record portal only accessible from its hospital offices
# - A financial firm deploys a compliance dashboard that must run in an App Service Environment with IP filtering
# - A large enterprise runs a legacy backend service within a private VNet, only accessible through a VPN
# - A manufacturing company integrates factory-floor APIs with private network restrictions and managed identity
#
# üöÄ Optional Enhancements (Commented Below):
# - Custom Linux runtime stack (Python, Node, .NET, or Docker)
# - Connection strings to databases or APIs (MySQL, Redis, Service Bus)
# - Diagnostic logging, backup, and monitoring integrations
# - Client certificate enforcement and path exclusions
# - App Insights instrumentation key injection via `app_settings`
# - Extended subnet-based access control with NSGs or Private Endpoints
